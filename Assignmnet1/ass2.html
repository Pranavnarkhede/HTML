        The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for
        being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally
        admired masterpieces of the world’s heritage”. It is regarded by many as
        the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India’s rich
        history1. The construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and was
        completed in 1653. It took a total of twenty-two years to complete the
        construction of this monument

      <p>
        Machu Picchu is believed to have been constructed as an estate for the
        Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472) and was occupied from c. 1420–15321.
        It is one of the New Seven Wonders of the World2. The Incas built the
        estate around 1450 but abandoned it a century later, at the time of the
        Spanish conquest1. Machu Picchu is located about 50 miles (80 km)
        northwest of Cuzco, Peru, in the Cordillera de Vilcabamba of the Andes
        Mountains3. The site was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983

        Chichen Itza is a ruined ancient Maya city occupying an area of 4 square
        miles (10 square km) in south-central Yucatán state, Mexico. It is
        thought to have been a religious, military, political, and commercial
        center that at its peak would have been home to 35,000 people

        The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone,
        brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an
        east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to
        protect against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The
        wall is 21,196 kilometers long1 and is more than 2700 years old today

      <p>
        Petra is one of the oldest cities in the world. Archaeologists believe
        the Nabateans established the city in 312 BC. It was the capital city of
        Nabateans, an ancient Arab tribe who inhabited northern Arabia and the
        southern Levant and arrived in Jordan around the 6th century BC1. Petra
        was voted one of the New 7 Wonders of the World in 20072. The entrance
        to Petra is the Siq, a narrow gorge around 1km long2. Petra’s
        centerpiece is the Treasury or Al-Khazneh, a 40 meters high monument
        with a stunning façade2.

        The Colosseum was built between 72 A.D and 80 A.D under the Emperor
        Vespasian, in the heart of Ancient Rome. It is made from stone and
        concrete, this magnificent monument was built with the man power of tens
        of thousands of slaves1. The Colosseum was the largest amphitheater in
        the Roman world measuring some 620 by 513 feet (190 by 155 meters)2. It
        was a freestanding structure made of stone and concrete2

      <p>
        The Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and largest of the three
        pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex created by the ancient Egyptians.
        It was built as a tomb for the pharaoh Khufu and was completed around
        2560 BCE. It is one of the oldest and most recognizable monuments in the
        world and is still considered one of the most remarkable engineering
        feats in history.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Great Pyramid of Giza is made up of an estimated 2.3 million
        limestone blocks and has a base width of over 230 meters. Its height was
        originally 146 meters but has since decreased to 138 meters due to
        weathering.
